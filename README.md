Hypline is a Python package that provides a CLI tool for cleaning and analyzing data from hyperscanning studies involving dyadic conversations.

## Installation

Hypline can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install hypline
```

It can also be installed using other package managers such as [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

## Quick Start

Once the package is installed, `hypline` command will be available, like so:

```bash
hypline --help

```
